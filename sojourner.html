		<h2>Sojourner's purpose</h2>
		<p>
			Sojourner is part of the Mars Pathfinder mission. Lauched on July 4, 1997, the mission was to determine the landing of rovers and technology in the most efficient way. Sojourner is a free-ranging rover that studies Mars by taking pictures and collecting rocks to analyze using a camera and a spectrometer. The Mars Pathfinder mission costs around $265 million. Though it may seem expensive, it can be called an investment to the future humans have on Mars.
